## Setup

This tutorial solves a heat conduction problem on a 2D domain which has an underlying micro-structure. This micro-structure changes the constituent quantities necessary for solving the problem on the macro scale. This leads to a two-scale problem with one macro-scale simulation and several micro-scale simulations.

![Case setup of two-scale-heat-conduction case](images/tutorials-two-scale-heat-conduction-macro-micro-schematic.png)

At each Gauss point of the macro domain there exists a micro simulation. The macro problem is one participant, which is coupled to many micro simulations. Each micro simulation is not an individual coupling participant, instead we use a managing software which controls all the micro simulations and their coupling via preCICE. The case is chosen from the first example case in the publication

## Available solvers and dependencies

* Both the macro and micro simulations are solved using the finite element library [Nutils](https://nutils.org/install.html) v7.
* The macro simulation is written in Python, so it requires the [Python bindings of preCICE](https://precice.org/installation-bindings-python.html)
* The [Micro Manager](https://precice.org/tooling-micro-manager-installation.html) controls all micro-simulations and facilitates coupling via preCICE. Use the [develop](https://github.com/precice/micro-manager/tree/develop) branch of the Micro Manager.

## Running the simulation

Run the macro problem:

```bash
cd macro-nutils
./run.sh
```

Check the Micro Manager [configuration](https://precice.org/tooling-micro-manager-configuration.html) and [running](https://precice.org/tooling-micro-manager-running.html) documentation to understand how to set it up and launch it. There is a Python script `run-micro-problems.py` in the tutorial directory to directly run the Micro Manager. This script imports the Micro Manager, and calls its `initialize()` and `solve()` methods. The Micro Manager can be run via this script in serial or parallel. Run it in serial:

```bash
cd micro-nutils
./run.sh -s
```

Run it in parallel:

```bash
cd micro-nutils
./run.sh -p <num_procs>
```

The `num_procs` needs to fit the decomposition specified in the `micro-manager-config.json` (default: two ranks).

Even though the case setup and involved physics is simple, each micro simulation is an instance of Nutils, which usually has a moderately high computation time. If the Micro Manager is run on 2 processors, the total runtime is approximately 25-30 minutes. Do not run the Micro Manager in serial, because the runtime will be several hours.

## Post-processing

![Results of two-scale-heat-conduction case](images/tutorials-two-scale-heat-conduction-results.png)

The participant `macro-nutils` outputs `macro-*.vtk` files which can be viewed in ParaView to see the macro concentration field. The Micro Manager uses the [export functionality](https://precice.org/configuration-export.html#enabling-exporters) of preCICE to output micro simulation data and [adaptivity related data](https://precice.org/tooling-micro-manager-configuration.html#adding-adaptivity-in-the-precice-xml-configuration) to VTU files which can be viewed in ParaView. To view the data on each micro simulation, create a Glyph on the Micro Manager VTU data. In the figure above, micro-scale porosity is shown. For a lower concentration value, the porosity increases (in the lower left corner).

![Evolving micro simulations](images/tutorials-two-scale-heat-conduction-evolving-micro-simulations.png)

The micro simulations themselves have a circular micro structure which is resolved in every time step. To output VTK files for each micro simulation, uncomment the `output()` function in the file `micro-nutils/micro.py`. The figure above shows the changing phase field used to represent the circular micro structure and the diffuse interface width.
