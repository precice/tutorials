keywords: OpenFOAM, python
summary: The 1D Elastic Tube is a FSI case, that consists of an internal flow in a flexible tube. The flow is unsteady and incompressible. This tutorial contains C++ and Python variants of the fluid and solid solvers. Running the simulation takes just 1-2 minutes.

## Setup

We want to simulate the internal flow in a flexible tube as shown in the figure below (image from [1]).

![FSI3 setup](images/tutorials-elastic-tube-1d-setup.png)

The flow is assumed to be incompressible flow and gravity is neglected. Due to the axisymmetry, the flow can be described using a quasi-two-dimensional continuity and momentum equations. The motivation and exact formulation of the equations that we consider can be found in [2].

The following parameters have been chosen:

- Length of the tube: L = 10
- Inlet velocity: $$ v_{inlet} = 10 + 3 sin (10 \pi t) $$
- Initial cross sectional area = 1
- Initial velocity: v = 10
- Initial pressure: p = 0
- Fluid density: $$ \rho = 1 $$
- Young modulus: E = 10000

Additionally the solvers use the parameters `N = 100` (number of cells), `tau = 0.01` (dimensionless timestep size), `kappa = 100` (dimensionless structural stiffness) by default. These values can be modified directly in each solver.

## Available solvers

Both fluid and solid participant are supported in:

- *C++*: example solvers using the intrinsic [C++ API of preCICE](https://precice.org/couple-your-code-api.html). The fluid solver also depends on LAPACK (e.g. on Ubuntu `sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev`)
- *Python*: example solvers using the preCICE [Python bindings](https://precice.org/installation-bindings-python.html). Both solvers depend on `numpy`. The fluid solver additionally depends on the Python libraries `scipy matplotlib`. You can get these libraries from your system package manager or with `pip3 install --user <package>`.
- *Rust*: example solvers using the preCICE [Rust bindings](https://precice.org/installation-bindings-rust.html). They need `cargo` to be installed.

## Running the Simulation

Choose one solver for each pariticipant, then open two separate terminals and start each soler by calling the respective run script.
Here we use both C++ solvers:

```bash
cd fluid-cpp
./run.sh
```

and

```bash
cd solid-cpp
./run.sh
```

**Optional for python-fluid:** A run-time plot visualization can be triggered by passing `--enable-plot` in `run.sh` of `FluidSolver.py`. Additionally a video of the run-time plot visualization can be generated by additionally passing `--write-video`

{% warning %}
The C++ and Python solvers lead to different results. Please consider the Python results as the correct ones and refer to this [open issue](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/issues/195) for more insight. Contributions are particularly welcome here.

## Post-processing

The results from each simulation are stored in each `fluid-<participant>/output/` folder. You can visualize these VTK files using the provided `plot-diameter.sh` script

```bash
./plot-diameter.sh
```

which will try to visualize the results from both fluid cases, if available. This script calls the more flexible `plot-vtk.py` Python script, which you can use as

```bash
python3 plot-vtk.py <quantity> <case>/output/<prefix>
```

Note the required arguments specifying which quantity to plot (`pressure`, `velocity` or `diameter`) and the name prefix of the target vtk files.

For example, to plot the diameter of the fluid-python case using the default prefix for VTK files, `plot-diameter.sh` executes:

```bash
python3 plot-vtk.py diameter fluid-python/output/out_fluid_
```

## Comparing different Fluid results

The Fluid participant defines a watchpoint at `x=5`, which records `pressure` and `diameter` for every timestep.
To compare the results of the various Fluid participants, you can run them all and plot the watchpoints using `plot-all.sh`.
The following is an example of running all Fluid solvers against the `solid-cpp` solver:
