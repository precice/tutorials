## Setup

In this tutorial we solve a partitioned heat equation. For information on the non-partitioned case, please refer to [1, p.37ff]. In this tutorial the computational domain is partitioned and coupled via preCICE. The coupling roughly follows the approach described in [2].

![Case setup of partitioned-heat-conduction case](images/tutorials-partitioned-heat-conduction-setup.png)

Case setup from [3]. `D` denotes the Dirichlet participant and `N` denotes the Neumann participant.

The heat equation is solved on a rectangular domain `Omega = [0,2] x [0,1]` with given Dirichlet boundary conditions. We split the domain at `x_c = 1` using a straight vertical line, the coupling interface. The left part of the domain will be referred to as the Dirichlet partition and the right part as the Neumann partition. To couple the two participant we use Dirichlet-Neumann coupling. Here, the Dirichlet participant receives Dirichlet boundary conditions (`Temperature`) at the coupling interface and solves the heat equation using these boundary conditions on the left part of the domain. Then the Dirichlet participant computes the resulting heat flux (`Flux`) from the solution and sends it to the Neumann participant. The Neumann participant uses the flux as a Neumann boundary condition to solve the heat equation on the right part of the domain. We then extract the temperature from the solution and send it back to the Dirichlet participant. This establishes the coupling between the two participants.

This simple case allows us to compare the solution for the partitioned case to a known analytical solution (method of manufactures solutions, see [1, p.37ff]). For more usage examples and details, please refer to [3, sect. 4.1].

## Available solvers and dependencies

You can either couple a solver with itself or different solvers with each other. In any case you will need to have preCICE and the python bindings installed on your system.

* `fenics`, requires you to install [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/download/) and the [FEniCS-adapter](https://github.com/precice/fenics-adapter). The code is largely based on this [fenics-tutorial](https://github.com/hplgit/fenics-tutorial/blob/master/pub/python/vol1/ft03_heat.py) from [1].


* :construction: This case is still under construction. See https://github.com/precice/tutorials/issues/152. :construction: `nutils`, requires you to install [Nutils](http://www.nutils.org/en/latest/).

## Running the simulation

### FEniCS

For choosing whether you want to run the Dirichlet-kind and a Neumann-kind participant, please provide the following commandline input:

* `-d` flag will enforce Dirichlet boundary conditions on the coupling interface.
* `-n` flag will enforce Neumann boundary conditions on the coupling interface.

For running the case, open two terminals and:

```
cd fenics
python3 heat.py -d
```

and

```
cd fenics
python3 heat.py -n
```

If you want to use Nutils for one or both sides of the setup, just `cd nutils`. The FEniCS case also supports parallel runs. Here, simply execute

```
mpirun -n <N_PROC> python3 heat.py -d
```

### Nutils

For running the case, open two terminals and:

```
cd nutils
./run_Dirichlet.sh
```

and

```
cd nutils
./run_Neumann.sh
```

### Nutils & FEniCS

You can mix the Nutils and FEniCS solver, if you like. Please provide the option `--error-tol=10e-3` to the FEniCS solver in this case. The accuracy of a mixed setup is lower than for a pure FEniCS setup and therefore the tolerance has to be increased.

We don't exactly know where this higher error comes from, but assume that it originates from mixing Gauss points (Nutils) with mesh points (FEniCS). This leads to a mapping error, even if identical meshes are used.

### Any combination of the solvers above

Feel free to mix any combination of Dirichlet- and Neumann-solvers by mixing the respective commands described above.

## Visualization

Output is written into the folders `fenics/out` and `nutils`. 

For FEniCS you can visualize the content with paraview by opening the `*.pvd` files. The files `Dirichlet.pvd` and `Neumann.pvd` correspond to the numerical solution of the Dirichlet, respectively Neumann, problem, while the files with the prefix `ref` correspond to the analytical reference solution, the files with `error` show the error and the files with `ranks` the ranks of the solvers (if executed in parallel).

For Nutils, please use the files `Dirichlet-*.vtk` or `Neumann-*.vtk`. Please note that these files contain the temperature as well as the reference solution.
