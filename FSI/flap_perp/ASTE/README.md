## Overview

This tutorial is an example how the Artificial Solver Testing Environment (ASTE) can be used.

It consists of 3 parts: 

1. Running a coupled simulation with 2 solvers that generates ```vtk``` output.
2. Transform the ```vtk``` files into the ASTE specific file format.
3. Exchanging one solver with ASTE.

## Requirements

To run this tutorial you need to install the following software:
- preCICE
- ASTE
- FEniCS
- FEniCS-Adapter
- OpenFOAM
- OpenFOAM Adapter
