The files in this folder can be used to run the tutorial test case described on this [Wiki page](https://github.com/precice/precice/wiki/FSI-tutorial). For running the case either follow the instructions given there or execute the script `runTutorial_serial.sh` or `runTutorial_parallel.sh` (with SU2 being executed with one or several processes, respectively).
