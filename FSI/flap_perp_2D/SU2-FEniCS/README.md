# Tutorial for a coupled simulation with SU2 and FEniCS

The files in this folder can be used to run the tutorial test case described on this [Wiki page](https://github.com/precice/precice/wiki/FSI-tutorial) except that the structural solver is now FEniCS. 
For running the case execute the script `Allrun` in one terminal or the scripts `runSolid` and `runFluid` in separate terminals.
Output data and visualization capabilites are similar to the case described in the above link.
