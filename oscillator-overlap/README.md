keywords: Python, ODE
summary: We solve an oscillator with two masses in a partitioned fashion with overlapping domain decomposition. Each mass is solved by an independent ODE.

## Setup

This tutorial solves the same problem as the [oscillator tutorial](https://precice.org/tutorials-oscillator.html), but applies a different domain decomposition strategy. See the oscillator tutorial for details on the general setup. The partitioning of the mass-spring system is shown here:

Note that this case applies an overlapping Schwarz-type coupling method and not (like most other tutorials in this repository) a Dirichlet-Neumann coupling. This results in a symmetric setup of the solvers. We will refer to the solver computing the trajectory of $m_1$ as `Mass-Left` and to the solver computing the trajectory of $m_2$ as `Mass-Right`. For more information, please refer to [1].

## Available solvers

This tutorial is only available in Python. You need to have preCICE and the Python bindings installed on your system.

- *Python*: An example solver using the preCICE [Python bindings](https://www.precice.org/installation-bindings-python.html). This solver also depends on the Python libraries `numpy`, which you can get from your system package manager or with `pip3 install --user <package>`.

## Running the Simulation

### Python

Open two separate terminals and start both participants by calling:

```bash
cd python
./run.sh -l
```

and

```bash
cd python
./run.sh -r
```
