## Setup

This case is a modified version of the [partitioned heat conduction tutorial](tutorials-partitioned-heat-conduction.html). Main modification is that we here use the [direct mesh access feature](couple-your-code-direct-access.html) to let the solvers compute the data mapping and not preCICE.

Further minor modifications:

- We use a parallel coupling scheme instead of a serial one to prevent running into the problem where we are trying to add a zero column to the quasi-Newton matrix. For serial coupling, this happens here because one data field converges much faster than the other.

## Configuration

## Available solvers

Currently only `nutils` is provided as a solver. The data mapping is computed by directly sampling the FEM function representation at the inquired locations.

## Running the simulation

Open two terminals and run:

```bash
cd neumann-nutils
./run.sh
```

and

```bash
cd dirichlet-nutils
./run.sh
```
