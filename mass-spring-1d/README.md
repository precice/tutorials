keywords: Python, 1D
summary: We solve an oscillator with two masses in a partitioned fashion. Each mass is solved by an independent process.

## Setup

The setup is taken from [1].

## Available solvers

This tutorial is only available in python. You will need to have preCICE and the python bindings installed on your system.

- *Python*: An example solver using the preCICE [Python bindings](https://www.precice.org/installation-bindings-python.html). This solver also depends on the Python libraries `numpy`, which you can get from your system package manager or with `pip3 install --user <package>`.

## Running the Simulation

### Python

Open two separate terminals and start each participant by calling:

```bash
python3 mass-spring.py MassOne
```

and

```bash
python3 mass-spring.py MassTwo
```

## Post-processing

TODO: Show how to perform convergence study. Show how to plot trajectory and inspect conservation of energy.
