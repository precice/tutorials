## [v202202.0] 2022-02-09

### Added

- Added new volume-coupled-diffusion tutorial with FEniCS [#219](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/pull/219).
- Added OpenFOAM case to partiitoned-heat [#223](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/pull/223).
- Added DUNE case to perpendicular-flap [#239](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/pull/239).
- Added FEniCS case to elastic-tube-3d [#223](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/pull/223).
- Added this changelog, describing also changes in previous releases [#225](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/pull/225).

### Changed

- Changed C3D8 elements to C3D8I elements in perpendicular-flap solid-calculix to improve the results [#250](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/pull/250).
- Ported the `visualize.py` script of the partitioned-elastic-beam to Python 3 [#247](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/pull/247).
- Reduced the writing frequency of the partitioned-pipe OpenFOAM cases [#257](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/pull/257).
- Renamed the output directories of all FEniCS cases for consistency [#256](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/pull/257).
- Removed unnecessary (wrong) read statement in `elastic-tube-1d` [#232](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/pull/232).
- Removed unnecessary (relic) OpenFOAM parameter `nMoles` from flow-over-heated-plate cases with OpenFOAM [#234](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/pull/234).
- Removed unnecessary (relic) OpenFOAM parameter `RAS` from the `turbulenceProperties` files of all OpenFOAM cases (we model a laminar flow everywhere and this was confusing) [#258](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/pull/258).
- Removed unnecessary (relic) OpenFOAM files `RASProperties` and `couplingProperties` from elastic-tube-3d [#258](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/pull/258).
- Removed unnecessary (relic) OpenFOAM file `radiationProperties` from heat-exchanger [#258](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/pull/258).
- Removed duplicate default settings from the `fvSchemes` OpenFOAM file of the heat-exchanger [#258](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/pull/258).
- Removed unnecessary (relic) fields and inaccurate copyright notices from the headers of several OpenFOAM files [#258](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/pull/258).
- Adjusted the formatting in several OpenFOAM files [#258](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/pull/258).
- Changed the versioning scheme from `<yearmonth>.<minor>.<bugfix>` to `<yearmonth>.<bugfix>`.

## [v202104.1.1] 2021-05-02

### Changed

- Modified the helper tool `openfoam_remove_empty_dirs` such that it also respects results in the compressed OpenFOAM format (76f4482).
- Synced the post-processing functionality of the elastic-tube-1d and the respective documentation. (#209)

## [v202104.1.0] 2021-04-23

- Added an easy-to-run tutorial called [quickstart](https://precice.org/quickstart.html).
- Added a validated Turek-Hron FSI3 case with OpenFOAM and non-linear deal.II.

### Changed
